# üí≥ Credit Card Fraud Detection & Anomaly Detection System
Welcome to the Credit Card Fraud Detection & Anomaly Detection System. This project aims to detect fraudulent transactions using various machine learning algorithms and provide an intuitive web-based UI for user interaction. The project utilizes HTML and CSS for the front-end UI, Flask for the back-end API, and multiple machine learning models such as SVM, Logistic Regression, and KMeans to perform fraud detection and anomaly detection tasks.

## üìã Project Overview
This project helps identify suspicious or fraudulent transactions in credit card usage. By employing several machine learning techniques, the system provides a high level of accuracy in detecting anomalies in transaction patterns. Users can interact with the system via a clean, intuitive web interface that allows for both data input and fraud detection results display.

## üéØ Key Features
Multiple Machine Learning Algorithms: The system utilizes a variety of ML models to enhance accuracy:
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Logistic Regression
- KMeans Clustering (for unsupervised anomaly detection)
- Random Forest (optional)
- Web-based UI: The front-end interface is built using HTML and CSS, providing a simple yet effective way to interact with the detection system.
- Flask API: The back-end is powered by Flask, which handles data processing and integrates the machine learning models with the UI.
- Real-time Detection: Users can input transaction data, and the system will immediately classify the transaction as 'Fraudulent' or 'Legitimate'.
- Visualization: The system can display graphical results of the anomaly detection process, showing patterns of suspicious transactions.

## üìä Algorithms Used
- Support Vector Machine (SVM): A supervised learning algorithm used for classification that separates fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions using hyperplanes.

- Logistic Regression: Another supervised learning algorithm, effective for binary classification problems, which predicts whether a transaction is fraudulent or legitimate.

- KMeans Clustering: An unsupervised learning algorithm used for anomaly detection, grouping transactions based on similarities and flagging unusual patterns.

- Random Forest: A powerful ensemble learning method that can be integrated for improved classification accuracy.

## üõ† Tech Stack
#### Frontend:
- HTML
- CSS
#### Backend:
- Python
- Flask
#### Machine Learning Libraries:
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy

## üñ•Ô∏è Usage
- Transaction Data Input: Users can input transaction details like amount, transaction time, and other relevant data through the web UI.

- Fraud Detection: Once the data is submitted, the system applies the machine learning algorithms to detect whether the transaction is fraudulent or not.

- Anomaly Detection: In addition to classification, KMeans clustering provides insights into outliers or anomalies in the dataset.

- Results Display: The system displays the prediction results (fraudulent or legitimate) on the web page and provides visualizations if needed.
